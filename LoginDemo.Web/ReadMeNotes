We add Web project.
We build the project, now VS will run MSBuild Tool to run c# compiler - to run across all code here.

We can place all class js and css files into one project but we should keep seperate.
This concept can be use is microservices concepts as well as 
in a scenerio when we have small untilities services which talk to database frequently. 
So it helps us to put data related abstraction into seperate project and than I can use into different project.

We can publish as Nuget Package as well which can ne use by different team in same organization. 

Query string doesnt influence the slection of the controller or action.



Diff between @Model.Property name and Html.DisplayFor is :
bu using Html.displayfor (allow us to use its configured annotation on view.)
