# LoginUserDemoEf6
Demonstrate the fundamental concepts of EF6 and c#. 

Application purpose is to show you how we can use EF with application. It does not have any purpose to show working model. 

Started with bank solution.
Create class library - to demonstrate how to create class/datamodel/entities.
How we can create class and merge to database and create tables over there.
Dependency injection concepts. 
SOLID principle. 
Application also build in a way that it make a less round trip to database and open less connection and need know how c# LINQ feature can help and can reduce perfomance as well if developer is not well aware about it.
Create another datamodel which says how to create all datamodels from your existing database.
Before all this steps we worked with localdb to start constructing it so we start form local db and than moved to sql database.
Its also says how to work with disconnected application like websites. 

There is many things which is important during development like how keep separate layres and reference so we can use in other projects and also we can create it's microservices
and publish it as nuget package in our company circle so other developer can use it. 
EF is involved a lot and many around the enterprise related feature so based on project requirement we can use its feature at every step. 

I try to keep around EF and C# language features. Many thing can be dicuss with applciation and create more development but because of tiem constraint 
I kept applciation development very short around CRUD operation.

Thank you.
